title: Samsung oven C-codes: the smart-range temperature family
description: Samsung C-21, C-24 and C-F2 explained: overheat shutdown, vent-area rapid rise and cooling-fan feedback on NE and NX ranges, with fixes and costs.
---

Samsung ranges and wall ovens — the NE and NX series, and their NV and NZ siblings — speak two error dialects. The two-part codes such as E-08 and E-27 cover the oven's heating parts, and the short codes such as SE and tE cover the control panel. Between them sits the C-family: C-21, C-24 and C-F2, the temperature and fan-monitoring codes tracked in the [Samsung oven code index](https://uk.codefixcoffee.com/samsung-oven-error-codes/). These are the ones most worth taking seriously, because at least one of them means the oven genuinely got too hot.

## There is no error log to read

Samsung ovens do not have a user-accessible error log. A code stays on the display until the cause is fixed or you cut power at the breaker — the C-code procedures use five to ten minutes — and if it returns after the reset, treat it as real rather than re-resetting and hoping.

## C-21: the overheat shutdown

[C-21](https://uk.codefixcoffee.com/samsung/range-wall-oven/c-21/) is the safety monitor reporting that the oven's internal temperature climbed above the safe window, so the board shut heating down. Owners have reported ranges becoming dangerously hot before the code appears, which makes this a stop-cooking signal rather than a nuisance. The usual culprit is the cavity temperature sensor or its harness; the main PCB is the second suspect.

1. Cut power at the breaker for five to ten minutes and retest once; if C-21 returns on the next heat-up, the fault is real.
2. Unplug the range, remove the two screws holding the sensor probe on the back wall of the cavity, and pull the harness forward to disconnect it.
3. Measure the sensor with a multimeter: around 1,080 ohms at room temperature is healthy. Open circuit or a wild reading means replace it.
4. Inspect the harness connector for heat damage where it passes near the element — a melted connector produces the same code.
5. If the sensor is good and it still trips, the board is misregulating the elements, which is a service-level repair.

## C-24: the rapid-rise check

[C-24](https://uk.codefixcoffee.com/samsung/range-wall-oven/c-24/) is detected around the ventilation and control area: the electronics compartment is warming faster than the board expects. Samsung documents the C-24/C-25 family as a heating over-temp condition tied to that ventilation area. In practice it splits three ways — a cooling fan that never spins up, blocked airflow around the range, or a failing over-temp thermistor reading a healthy area as hot.

Diagnosis is mostly listening and looking. Reset at the breaker, run a bake cycle and listen for the convection and cooling fan as the oven heats; silence is your answer. Check installation clearance and that no vents under or behind the range are blocked by cabinetry, foil or dust. With power off, the over-temp thermistor can be metered at its connector — it reads in the same roughly 1,000-ohm class as the cavity sensor, and one that is open or drifting gets replaced. If the fan is dead, replace it before the control board cooks itself: the heat is the cause, and the board is the casualty.

## C-F2: cooling-fan feedback

[C-F2](https://uk.codefixcoffee.com/samsung/range-wall-oven/c-f2/) looks like an overheat code but usually is not. The C-F family is the control system reporting that a monitored component is not answering, and with C-F2 that component is the cooling-fan circuit: the display board is not receiving the feedback signal it expects. Either the fan genuinely is not running, its connector is loose or scorched, or the feedback line to the board has failed.

Work through it in order. After a breaker reset, heat the oven and confirm whether the fan physically spins. A spinning fan with the code persisting points at the feedback path: reseat the fan connector on the board and look for heat-discoloured pins. A silent fan means checking for a jammed blade — dust, or a dropped screw behind the panel — and then measuring the winding for an open circuit. Fan and connector fixes are cheap; a C-F2 that survives both checks points to the main board input.

## What the parts cost

Cavity temperature sensors run €15 to €40 and are ten-minute screwdriver parts — the most common fix in this family. Cooling fans are €40 to €90 and harnesses €10 to €20. The expensive item is the main PCB at €150 to €300, and you should only be shopping for one after the sensor and the fan have checked out. A technician's visit costs about €120 to €250 for diagnosis plus the part; on an out-of-warranty range with a board-level fault, getting that quote before ordering anything is the sensible order of operations.

One rule applies across the whole family: do not keep resetting a C-21 and continuing to cook. The code means the board has already seen a temperature it did not like, and the next trip may be higher up the scale.
