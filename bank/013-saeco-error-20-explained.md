Error 20 on a Philips or Saeco super-automatic is one of those codes that sounds serious and usually is not. It appears across the range Philips labels Error 01 to 22 — LatteGo 2200/3200/4300/5400, Xelsis, Incanto and older Saeco machines — and it belongs to the Xelsis-class fault family the manuals route to two places: the brew unit, and the row of switches that watches your drip tray, grounds container and service door. We keep a full [Error 20 reference page](https://uk.codefixcoffee.com/philips-saeco/espresso-machines/error-20/); this post explains why seating everything matters, and when the problem really is deeper.

## What the machine is actually complaining about

Philips does not publish a per-code table for its service codes, so nobody outside the service department can promise exactly which component Error 20 names on every model. What the Xelsis-era manuals do make clear is the direction: numeric errors in this range point at the brew group not being detected in position, or at a service component — the drip tray, the coffee grounds container, the service door — not being seated.

Before and during every brew cycle, the machine checks a set of interlocks and a brew-group position sensor. If any one of them reports "not right", the cycle stops and the display raises Error 20:

- the brew group must be present and sitting in its rest position
- the drip tray must be pushed fully home
- the grounds container must be clicked in on top of it
- the service door must be fully closed

None of this is fussiness. A super-automatic drives the brew unit through a real mechanical cycle, and it refuses to attempt that with the door open or the group half-engaged. In practice, plenty of Error 20s come down to a tray a few millimetres short of clicked-in, or wet grounds bridging a contact.

## The documented reset: five minutes, no parts

1. Switch the machine off and unplug it.
2. Remove and refit the drip tray and the coffee grounds container, firmly, so both click.
3. Close the service door fully.
4. Switch the machine back on.

This is the reset the manual documents for this fault family, and the reseat-and-restart sequence genuinely clears most cases. If the code is gone afterwards, you are finished — but read the next section anyway, because an Error 20 that keeps coming back is telling you something.

### If it returns: clean the brew group

On machines where the brew group is removable (most LatteGo and Incanto models), the next suspect is the group itself:

1. Switch off, open the service door and remove the brew group.
2. Rinse it thoroughly under lukewarm water — no soap — and let it air dry.
3. Put a little food-safe silicone grease on the guide rails and the piston seal.
4. Refit it along the guides until it clicks, close the door and switch on.

Then run a rinse cycle. If the code clears, follow up with the machine's cleaning cycle: a brew unit sticky with coffee oils is the usual underlying cause of repeat Error 20s, and the cleaning cycle is what addresses it.

One caution: on Xelsis models where the brew group is internal rather than removable, do not force the service door to get at it. That version of the repair is a bench job.

The neighbouring codes tell a similar story — Error 03 is the "brew group too dirty" code and Error 04 is "brew group not correctly placed" — and the whole family is covered on the [Philips / Saeco hub](https://uk.codefixcoffee.com/philips-saeco/).

## When it really is the motor or position sensor

If Error 20 persists with the tray, container and door verifiably seated and the group clean and lubricated, the picture changes: either the brew-group motor cannot complete its cycle, or the position sensor is not reading it back. Both are internal repairs — Philips support routes these to saeco.com/care — and neither has a user-level fix worth attempting.

Do not confuse this with the other serious Saeco family. Error 02, 10, 15 and 22 are the internal electronics, pump and valve faults that Philips says need service outright; a useful tell is timing, with codes appearing at startup usually pointing at the brew-group drive or a valve, and codes appearing mid-brew at the pump or pressure side. The details are on the [Error 02, 10, 15 and 22 page](https://uk.codefixcoffee.com/philips-saeco/espresso-machines/error-02-10-15-or-22/).

## What it costs

- Silicone grease: around €10, and it is the only "part" most Error 20s ever need.
- A replacement brew group, if yours is damaged: roughly €80 to €140.
- Out-of-warranty manufacturer service on a super-automatic: typically €250 to €500 including return shipping; independent espresso repairers are usually cheaper for a single-part fix.

On a Xelsis or LatteGo-class machine the repair is worth it — and the odds are good you will never reach the third bullet. Start with the [Error 20 page](https://uk.codefixcoffee.com/philips-saeco/espresso-machines/error-20/), work the reset in order, and only pick up the phone once everything is clean, greased and clicked in.
